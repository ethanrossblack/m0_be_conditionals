# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code?
    * *Conditionals are extremely useful for deciding when to execute or not based on if a variable (or something else) meets the proper set of conditions.*
1. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?
    * *I probably would not spend as much time being a smart-ass about cannibalism and just move on to the next assignment. (Though I'm happy to debate whether or not attendees can also be meals with anyone in the study hall channel any time).*  
    * *Also, continuing to improve on my Loom video planning and explanations. I messed up my `elsif` statements, confusing them with `elif` statements in Python.*
1. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why?
    * *I did enjoy learning about each conditional method and figuring out the arithmetic operators in Ruby (though I used their wordier counterparts for explanation purposes).*
    * *Also, it felt good that I could do the "spicy" problem without a sweat.*
